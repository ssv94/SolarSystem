          <p>Earth, our home planet is the third planet from the Sun. At approximately 4.5 billion years of age, it is the only known astronomical object that supports life. Only about 30% of Earth's surface is solid land, whilst the other 70% is liquid water, most of it in the form of oceans. Earth's landforms are quite diverse, consisting of deserts, mountains, plains, valleys, plateaus and more. Approximately 66 million years ago, when dinosaurs roamed the lands, Earth was struck by a 10-15 kilometer wide asteroid known as the Chicxulub impactor which decimated 75% of the species on Earth, causing devastating long-term effects on the planet.</p>

      <img src="mars.webp" alt="Planet Mars">
      <p>Mars, often referred to as the “Red Planet” due to its surface's reddish color, is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is roughly half the size of Earth with its geological features consisting of vast plains, deep canyons, craters, polar ice caps and massive volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons which happens to be the largest volcano in the entire Solar System. Due to Mars's insignificant gravity, you would be able to jump three times higher than on Earth. As you are reading this, right at this moment there are three rovers (Curiosity, Perseverance, Zhurong) operating on the red planet's surface. According to NASA, they are hoping to send the first humans to Mars by the 2030's.</p>

      <img src="jupiter.webp" alt="Planet Jupiter">
      <p>Jupiter, a gas giant, is the largest planet and the fifth from the Sun in our Solar System. Due to it being a gas giant, it is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. Even if we'd combine the other seven planets in our Solar System, Jupiter would still be more than twice the size of the combined planets. This massive planet has 80 moons orbiting it, with the largest of them being Ganymede which in fact is the largest moon in the entire Solar System. The most recognizable feature on Jupiter is the great red spot which is an enormous long-lived storm system.</p>

      <img src="neptune.webp" alt="Planet Neptune">
      <p>Neptune, an ice giant, is the eight planet from the Sun which makes it the farthest one. It is known for its stunning blue color and extreme weather conditions, such as supersonic winds which are the strongest winds in the entire Solar System. At least 80% of Neptune's mass consists of composed water, ammonia and methane ices above a small rocky core. Unlike the other planets within our Solar System, Neptune is the only one that isn't visible to the naked eye. With it being the farthest planet from the Sun, a single Neptunian year takes around 165 Earth years.</p>

      <img src="mercury.webp" alt="Planet Mercury">
      <p>Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun in our Solar System. It takes about 88 Earth days for Mercury to fully orbit around the Sun. And roughly 59 Earth days for the planet to rotate completely around its own axis. Its diameter is only about 4,879 kilometers, making it roughly 0.055 times of Earth, only being little bigger than Earth's Moon. Mercury barely has an atmosphere at all which has resulted in its rocky surface being heavily cratered as there is basically nothing protecting the planet from space debris. Despite its close proximity to the Sun, it isn't the hottest planet within our Solar System. That title actually belongs to Venus.</p>

      <img src="venus.webp" alt="Planet Venus">
      <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is similar to Earth in its size and composition. Like the other planets within the inner region of the Solar System, Venus too is a terrestrial and a rocky planet. Craters, volcanoes, mountains and large lava plains cover the planet's surface. Due to Venus's atmospheric pressure being roughly 92 times that of Earth's, it's temperatures on the surface can reach up to a staggering 470 degrees Celsius, thus making it the hottest planet in the entire Solar System. Venus is covered by thick clouds that pour down sulfuric acid on the planet's surface as well as whip the planet at immense speeds.</p>

      <img src="saturn.webp" alt="Planet Saturn">
      <p>Saturn, known for its incredibly stunning rings is the sixth planet from the Sun. Like Jupiter, Saturn too is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium with a small rocky core at its center. If one were to drop Saturn into an ocean, the planet would actually float on the water due to its gassy composition. The awe-inspiring complex system of planetary rings that circle the planet are composed of countless small particles, mostly ice and rock. Even though Saturn isn't the only planet that has rings around it, its rings are the only ones that can be seen from Earth.</p>

      <img src="uranus.webp" alt="Planet Uranus">
      <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and one of the two ice giants within our Solar System. Unlike the rest of the planets, Uranus rotates on its side due to its axis of rotation being tilted only at 98 degrees. Like Neptune, 80% of Uranus's mass consists of composed water, ammonia as well as methane above a small rocky core. This distant ice giant is the coldest planet in our Solar System with the lowest temperature measured at -224 degrees Celsius. Around Uranus there is a system of 13 known rings which are primarily dark as well as narrow compared to the magnificent and bright rings of Saturn.</p>
